Hi! I am a student in Computer Science and a prospective Machine Learning researcher. 

## Education
I will be receiving a B.S. Degree in **Computer Science** (minor in **Mathematics**) from **Purdue University**-West Lafayette in December 2023. 

Along with the major in Computer Science, I enrolled in **Machine Intelligence** track for the CS-concentration. I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence in general, and especially in Machine Learning.
